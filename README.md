My personal try on the homework assignments, starting at HW03.

The following assignments have their own branches to easier track progress,
please have a look at them.

Notes for myself:

- To push a non-master branch to a Heroku app, do a
  ```git push <heroku-app-name> <my-branch-name>:master```

  The ```:master``` denotes that the my branch runs on the specified Heroku app
  as a master, which in turn is required for building.
